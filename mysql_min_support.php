   desc: This was created to support the ajax server side database actions.  The 
   site_fns_diminished.php and mypicks_db.php were just to big.
   
  notes: Functions included here copied from the "big" files so they cannot
  be included.  Requiring site_fns_diminished.php, for example, would cause a 
  collision with db_connect() which is defined here.
  
  I decided to not rename a new set of support functions for callbacks since
  these already work and as new support is required working code be pasted in.
