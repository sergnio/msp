         - Issue may arise at mysuperpicks.com.   Here are some that concern me. <br />
         --- mysuperpicks.com does not use the same mysql server that drillbrain does.<br />
         --- The _SERVER vars are different.  I had to rewrite site recognition code to accommodate it.<br />
         --- Redirection may fail - same reason - the _SERVER vars are different<br />
         --- I don't know how the mail is setup here.  That should be exercised.<br />
         --- Login timeouts differ and perhaps server configurations.  I assume the cookies will validate for 30 days, but I don't know.<br />
         --- SO, <b>please do all you testing at the mysuperpicks.com site.</b><br /><br />

         - A registered user would fail joining a league if he reused his playername.  Fixed.  Removed unique index on playername.  The
         unique key is UNIQUE KEY `leagueid` (`leagueid`,`playername`)  (dev note: applied at godaddy <pre> ALTER TABLE nspx_leagueplayer
  DROP INDEX playername)</pre><br />
  This probably fixed the second image of 'Finally, I've included two more screenshots of errors we encountered:', with 'The system failed to install new user'.
  I installed better monitoring on this new user function.  If it fails again I'll know why. <br /><br />

         -  Pickem standings page.  Hide picks until game start OR the admin scores the match.  As discussed, admin, and maybe the commissioner, 
         have additional rights and could view this data.<br />

         -  The toggle error in 'This Week's Lines' is correct.  Week 7 has 6 picks.  The condition is a 'serious' error.  There is a question now
         as to how it should be handled.  Here's the message <b> 'Info!  There has been a system error. Please contact the site administrator.(ref p>limit 6)'</b><br />

KO cohort behavior

process_week == the current week being processed - checked for winners and losers
next week == the week directly following the process_week
lastround == commission defined value marking end of play.  The game can be ended at any time.
hard_end == completes play as in, this is the final round of play.  Winners are indicated
   (if any - can have no winners in first round)

   hard_end == (process_week == lastround) || (process_week == last week of NFL season)

For the purpose of process_week calculations, next week data is considered only if next week 
   games (any game) are not pending.

# All loose first week  (next week - don't care)
- game is over
- addition activity ignored
- there are no winners

# One player wins (next week - don't care)
- game is over
- picks are marked
- winner is marked
- additional activity is ignored

#a >1 player wins (next week - unavailable)
- game continues
- picks are marked
- there are no winners

#b >1 player wins (next week - available - no winners)
- game is over
- picks are marked
- winners are marked

#c >1 player wins (next week - available - there are winners)
- game continues
- picks are marked
- there are no winners

Special conditions.

Any player failing to pick forever forfeits.   He will not be included in further play.

Access to play is denied until the defined first week of play is >= the active week. 
   The active week is set by the site admin.

To play: Player must be active && user account must be active && league must be 
   active && finalround must be ZERO

Player picks are not shown in standings until the game begins (unless scored)

Scoring always exposes team names.  Scored games are not pending.
